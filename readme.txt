The plugin allows customization of CSS files in a separate folder for the OrderStorm eCommerce plugin.
CAUTION: MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE AN UPGRADE.

== Description ==
Never lose the changes you make to your style sheets in an update of the OrderStorm e-Commerce plugin. The OrderStorm eCommerce Custom Files Manager sets up a second folder called **orderstorm-wordpress-e-commerce-custom** that contains a duplicate set of .css files for your shopping cart. You no longer need to worry about creating a separate backup of your style sheets prior to an upgrade. By using the OrderStorm eCommerce Custom Files Manager, its done for you.  After the plugin is installed, make all changes to the OrderStorm e-Commerce .css files in the Custom Files Manager plugin edit screen instead of to the .css files in the main plugin.

== Installation ==
From the dashboard, under Plugins, select Add New. Search for OrderStorm. Click on Install Now.

or

1. Download the plugin .zip file.
2. Log in to your WordPress dashboard and click on the 'Plugins' tab and then 'Add New.'
3. Click on 'Upload' near the top of the page.</br>
4. Click the 'Choose File' button and find the OrderStorm WordPress eCommerce Files Manager plugin .zip file. Click 'Choose' followed by the 'Install Now' button.  WordPress will now upload and install your plugin.
5. Once the installation of your plugin has finished click the 'Activate Plugin' link.

== Setup ==
**Note**: You must have the OrderStorm e-Commerce plugin installed to use this plugin.

1. To change the look of your shopping cart categories and products, go to the Plugin page. Then go to OrderStorm eCommerce Files Manager plugin, click on 'Edit'.
2. The .css files controlling the appearance of the categories, subcategories and products are here.  You can completely customize colors, fonts, product display, product box sizes etc.
3. Make all of your style changes here, not in the .css files that came with the OrderStorm eCommerce plugin itself.
4. OrderStorm will overwrite the main plugin .css files when we issue updates to the shopping cart functionality. If an orderstorm-wordpress-e-commerce-custom folder exists and your .css files are stored in this separate folder, the OrderStorm eCommerce plugin will check here first and display these files first so your changes will not be lost with an update. If no orderstorm-wordpress-e-commerce-custom folder exists, the plugin will display the default .css files. You will have to back them up manually before you update your shopping cart.
